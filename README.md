### Introduction

**But why develop SCA?**  
Playing holds significant importance for a myriad of deeply rooted reasons, stemming from the belief that direct social interactions and the bonds they create are essential for a fulfilling and happy life. At the heart of this reflection is the idea that gathering to play represents one of the most genuine and rewarding forms of social expression, an activity that not only strengthens interpersonal relationships but also serves as valuable teaching for younger generations.

The game, as a moment of meeting and sharing, emerges as a fundamental vehicle for conveying values of cooperation, strategy, and fair competition. Playful learning stimulates the mind to develop tactics and strategies, inviting participants to intellectually challenge each other in a stimulating contest environment. This dynamic proves not only fascinating but also educational, as it teaches to rejoice in victories and gracefully accept defeats.

Particularly significant is the lesson derived from the experience of loss: learning to manage frustration is not only instructive but acts as a catalyst for personal improvement. This growth process through play prepares children to become more resilient adults, equipped with the necessary tools to face life's inevitable challenges.

**Personal Motivations:**  
1. I enjoy playing.  
2. A personal passion for designing and an opportunity to study and apply interesting technologies.  
3. The desire to share these experiences with my growing child, promoting his educational growth.

**Why a White Paper?**  
To share a game proposal, highlighting the importance of collaboration and perspective sharing to enrich the project.

### Problem or Need

Since my childhood, I've spent hours, indeed, entire days, immersed in LAN parties with friends. Reflecting on it as an adult, these memories represent much more than just playing; they are indelibly linked to growing up together, sharing unique formative experiences. However, not everything was simple and without obstacles.

One of the major challenges we faced was the time limit. In turn-based strategy games, especially when played in groups of more than three people, matches tended to be excessively long. Often, just when we were reaching the climax of the competition, we found ourselves forced to stop for family commitments like dinner or to avoid scolding from parents. This time limitation not only interrupted the flow of the game but also diminished the value of the shared experience.

Another fundamental aspect was the social element of the game: the good-natured teasing among friends. This socialization element loses meaning if the outcome of the game is heavily influenced by randomness. Laughing or joking about the outcome of a game dominated by chance is comparable to mocking someone for not winning the lottery; it's obvious that few win in a lottery, and the element of skill and ingenuity is virtually absent.

These memories and reflections inspired the creation of Super Competitive Arena: a game that seeks to overcome these limitations, promoting a fast-paced gaming experience based on skill and strategy rather than chance. The goal is to recreate the intensity and fun of my youth gaming sessions, eliminating the obstacles that limited enjoyment, while simultaneously valuing the intellectual and strategic contribution of each player.

### Proposed Solution
To effectively address the identified challenges, we propose the development of an innovative game, Super Competitive Arena, based on two fundamental principles aimed at revolutionizing the traditional gaming experience:

**1. Absence of Randomness:** The first pillar of our game is the complete elimination of the random element. In Super Competitive Arena, each player is fully responsible for their own moves and strategies. This principle ensures that a player's success or failure depends exclusively on their decision-making abilities and strategic skill. The goal is to value intelligence, planning, and ingenuity, creating a context where merit and competence are the only factors determining the outcome of the match.

**2. Uniform Game Times:** The second key principle is to ensure that, regardless of the number of participants, the duration of each turn remains constant. This innovative approach is designed to optimize the gaming experience, ensuring that sessions are dynamic and engaging for all players, without excessively prolonging. Regardless of how many friends join the challenge, the pace of the game remains fast and accessible, allowing full enjoyment of the gaming experience without concern for the time limitations that characterized traditional gaming sessions.

Super Competitive Arena is conceived to be more than just a game: it is a direct response to the needs of those seeking an authentic, fair, and stimulating gaming experience. Through these two principles, we aspire to create an environment where competition, socialization, and fun coexist in perfect balance, offering a unique and unforgettable experience to players of all ages.

Furthermore, I would like to maintain a parallel between the first-person gaming experience and the online one to ensure a communicative space that goes beyond personal mobility possibilities.

### Comparison with Other Solutions
While we draw inspiration from classics like chess and modern games like Xwing, Super Competitive Arena stands out for its absence of randomness and the dynamism of turns, offering a new and engaging experience that encourages strategy and planning.

### Implementation
To bring Super Competitive Arena to market, we will develop a beta version that includes:
- A rulebook
- A game board
- A set of cards
- Game pieces

We aim to build a collaborative organization that values the contribution of each participant, with the goal of creating a game that is innovative, educational, and fun at the same time.
