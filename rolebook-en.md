**Ability Selection**
1. Each player reveals their champion and places it face up in front of them.
2. Place the Concentration, Recovery, and Vitality dice next to your champion's card. Set the Concentration and Recovery dice to 0, and the Vitality die to the value shown on your champion.
3. Give each player an ability deck.
4. Starting with the white cards, players select a number of cards equal to the value shown in the White box on their champion and display them to other players. Follow this process for all other colors. If a player has a zero value for any color, they wait until the other players have finished selecting their abilities. At any point, other players can request a check to ensure the number of cards of a specific color matches the quantity listed on that player's champion.
5. Once the ability selection is complete, the remaining ability deck cards are set aside as they will no longer be accessible during the battle.

### THE BATTLE BEGINS!!

**Game Phases**
Each assault in the arena is divided into four actions. After these, there is a recovery phase where champions gather ideas to organize their attack strategy for the next assault.

1. Action Selection - Each player chooses a card, sets their orientation wheel, and places them face down in front of them.
2. Revelation - Each player reveals their card and orientation.
3. Assignment of Quick Effects - All quick effects or damage due to quick effects are distributed on the board. Champions on a tile assigned damage suffer that amount.
4. Movement - Champions are moved based on the movements. Champions that cross or end their movement on a damaged tile suffer all the damage present.
5. Assignment of Slow Effects - All damage due to slow effects is distributed on the board. Champions on a tile assigned damage suffer that amount.

If four actions have been performed, move to the recovery phase; otherwise, return to phase 1.
6. Recovery - All played cards are placed in the discard pile. Each player can choose to spend their recovery points to retrieve one or more cards from the discard pile.
(decide whether recovery happens every 4, 5 turns, or at discretion after each action)

**VICTORY**
If no warriors are alive on the battlefield, no one can declare victory.
